## Edward Packard

I am a highly-motivated individual who always brings an infectious enthiusiasm to the teams and projects I am involved in. My background in teaching and researching history has equipped me with a formidable work ethic, outstanding analytical and communication skills, and a strong sense of empathy.

After a rewarding decade working as an academic, I found myself searching for a new challenge: this is why I undertook and completed the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) software development bootcamp. Makers encouraged me to reflect deeply on how I learn: during this journey, I was hugely inspired by the coaches and my cohort.

Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by computers and the rapid development of technology: as a child, I remember spending hours typing out (and adapting) code from computer magazines and getting books out of the local library to find out more about programming. I would have loved something like Stack Overflow back then! I now want to spend the next part of my career building software that will hopefully help to make the world a better place.

I blog about my experiences learning to code [here](https://edpackard.medium.com/). I can also be found on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/edpackard).

## Coding strengths

#### Test-Driven Development

- Learning TDD was one of the highlights of the Makers Academy bootcamp, and I really enjoy seeing code 'emerge' out of my tests. I am committed to refining my TDD process and attended every process workshop during the Makers bootcamp. I have also undertaken several external reviews of my process.
- Feedback from a recent review: 'Your tests were based on the expected inputs and outputs of the system. This is great as it promotes flexibility in your code while keeping it focused on the behaviour of the system. You are working in an incremental manner and with each new test, you are introducing a small change to the algorithm which allows you to focus on less complexity at any given time.'

#### Debugging

- I have an analytical mindset and a keen eye for spotting bugs. I use multiple tools to tighten the loop and isolate problems in my code.
- Feedback from a recent review: 'You used the backtrace messages as effective feedback on the issues you were meant to address for your tests to pass. Consequently, you managed to maintain a steady pace throughout the review. You also used print statements to expose the internal state of your programme, allowing you to make changes while developing the iteration for your programme. Other than that, you did not run into too many show-stopping bugs, which was incredible!'

#### Pair Programming

- I am a strong team player, and my best coding experiences have been collaborative, especially through pair programming.
- People I have paired with have provided positive feedback, such as describing me as a 'thoughtful navigator', and have often complimented the clarity of my explanations.

## Education

#### Makers Academy, June 2021 - October 2021

Makers is an intensive software development bootcamp focusing on TDD/BDD, OOP, and Agile processes. As a Makers graduate I am able to:
- effectively use multiple learning and working styles: self-led learning, pair programming challenges, and group engineering projects.
- learn new languages and frameworks fast - I am language agnostic.
- use relational and non-relational databases.
- test-drive my code with multiple frameworks including RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest and Cypress.
- debug my code with appropriate tools and approaches.
- build full-stack applications, including the MERN stack.
- comfortably use Git/Github version control, and the command line.
- practice Emotional Intelligence (EQ) to enhance my communication, collaboration, mentoring and reflective skills
- pair program effectively, both as driver and navigator
- lead group planning and rituals (standups, retros etc) using tools such as Trello and EasyRetro

## Work Experience

**University of Suffolk** (September 2010 to June 2021)  
_Lecturer in History_

- I designed, led, delivered, and assessed undergraduate degree modules, mainly related to modern European and international history, using my communication, time management, feedback and interpersonal skills. My modules consistently received outstanding feedback from students (including nominations for awards) and I contributed to the History programme receiving national recognition for its student satisfaction. As a result of this work, I developed expertise in Quality Assurance, and am currently an external examiner at another UK Higher Education Institution
- As widening participation leader for History, I demonstrated my commitment to inclusivity and improved the recruitment of students from non-typical backgrounds through a combination of networking and empathy alongside strategic and analytical thinking.
- I drove departmental and institutional change related to student assessment procedures, adopting a strategic approach and using my team-working and peacemaking skills. This included innovation in the use of online learning environments and resources, such as leading a team in the implementation of online assessment best practices.
- To engage wider audiences in the latest academic ideas, I used storytelling approaches in public engagement activities ranging from successful events to media appearances (including the BBC).

**David Game College, University Foundation Programme** (January to June 2010)  
_History Teacher_

- I used coaching, empathy and communication to enable students from diverse international backgrounds to achieve qualifications to enter UK universities.
- I designed, delivered and assessed a well-received history curriculum at short notice, demonstrating time management, strategic and communication skills.

**Freelance** (February to March 2010)  
_Historical Researcher_

- Demonstrated time management and strategic skills by undertaking professional historical research across multiple archives to a tight deadline for a client.
- Produced a high-quality written report which formed the basis of displays, events and educational resources in a major London park.

**London School of Economics and Political Science** (2005-2008, 2010-2011)  
_Graduate Teaching Assistant_

- I used time management and communication skills, combined with pedagogical study, to deliver seminar teaching, indvidual tutorials, and assessment of student work, alongside my own PhD studies.

## Hobbies
-- Collecting, modifying, and playing with retro computers and video game consoles: ask me how many Nintendo Game Boys I have accumulated!
- Guitar: I am not a talented musician, but I have been taking electric guitar lessons for five years and enjoy the challenge of learning new songs and techniques.
- Swimming: I regularly swim for relaxation and exercise. I have set myself the target of 120 swims in 2021 - and my next personal coding project is to build an app to log my swimming.
