## Edward Packard

I am a highly motivated individual who always brings an infectious enthiusiasm to the teams and projects I am involved in. My background in teaching and researching history has equipped me with a formidable work ethic, outstanding analytical skills, and a strong sense of empathy. 

After a rewarding decade working as an academic, I found myself searching for a new challenge: this is why I undertook and completed the Makers software development bootcamp.

Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by computers and the rapid development of technology, and I want to spend the next part of my career building software that will hopefully help to make the world a better place.

I blog about my experiences learning to code [here](https://edpackard.medium.com/). I can also be found on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/edpackard).
