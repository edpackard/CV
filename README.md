## Edward Packard

I am a highly motivated individual who always brings an infectious enthiusiasm to the teams and projects I am involved in. My background in teaching and researching history has equipped me with a formidable work ethic, outstanding analytical and communication skills, and a strong sense of empathy.

After a rewarding decade working as an academic, I found myself searching for a new challenge: this is why I undertook and completed the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) software development bootcamp. Makers encouraged me to reflect deeply on how I learn: during this journey, I was hugely inspired by the coaches and my cohort.

Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by computers and the rapid development of technology: as a child, I remember spending hours typing out (and adapting) code from computer magazines and getting books out of the local library to find out more about programming. I would have loved something like Stack Overflow back then! I want to spend the next part of my career building software that will hopefully help to make the world a better place.

I blog about my experiences learning to code [here](https://edpackard.medium.com/). I can also be found on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/edpackard).

## Coding strengths

#### Test-Driven Development

- Learning TDD was a real highlight of the Makers Academy bootcamp, and I really enjoy seeing code 'emerge' out of my tests. I am committed to refining my TDD process and attended every process workshop during the Makers bootcamp, and have also undertaken several external reviews of my process.
- Feedback from a recent review: 'Your tests were based on the expected inputs and outputs of the system. This is great as it promotes flexibility in your code while keeping it focused on the behaviour of the system. You are working in an incremental manner and with each new test, you are introducing a small change to the algorithm which allows you to focus on less complexity at any given time.'

#### Debugging

- I have an analytical mindset and a keen eye for spotting bugs. I use multiple tools to tighten the loop and isolate problems in my code.
- Feedback from a recent review: 'You used the backtrace messages as effective feedback on the issues you were meant to address for your tests to pass. Consequently, you managed to maintain a steady pace throughout the review. You also used print statements to expose the internal state of your programme, allowing you to make changes while developing the iteration for your programme. Other than that, you did not run into too many show-stopping bugs, which was incredible!'

#### Pair Programming

- I am a strong team player, and my best coding experiences have been collaborative, especially through pair programming.
- Pair programming provides me with opportunities to demonstrate and develop my excellent communication skills. People I have paired with have provided positive feedback, and often compliment the clarity of my explanations.

## Education

#### Makers Academy, June 2021 - October 2021

- Intensive software development bootcamp focusing on TDD/BDD, OOP, and Agile processes
- Multiple learning and working styles: self-led learning, pair programming challenges, and group engineering projects
